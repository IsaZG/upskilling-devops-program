1. Download the bash-create-image-container-sh in the folder you want to run the project.
2. The bash will download a repo from the next url: https://github.com/IsaZG/atlas-template.
3. That repo contains the template selected from the sugested url in the Lab specification
and the dockerfile that will help you to run the image for the website.
4. You just need to download the bash from this repo: https://github.com/IsaZG/upskilling-devops-program which is in the second-laboratoy folder,
and run the bash file in the selected directory.

* For the second part of the laboratory
1. Download the bash-docker-compose-image.sh in the folder you want to run the project.
2. The bash will download a repo from the next url: https://github.com/IsaZG/atlas-template.
3. That repo contains the template selected from the sugested url in the Lab specification, the docker-compose
file that will generate the images and containers, and the dockerfile that will help you to generate
the image for the web-container
